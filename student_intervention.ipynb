    "Our goal is identify students likely to not graduate (or to graduate), and hopefully provide aid (intervention) to these students to help them graduate. Therefore, we want to design a model that learns on our current data where the target attribute is whether or not a student graduates. That is, we want to build a learner that predicts a discrete output space which is [graduate, not graduate]. Because the model we want to build labels a discrete output, we are building a classification model and in this case it is a binary classification model (i.e. just two labels, or said another way two possible values in the target variable).\n",

Examples include: predicting wheter or not a cat is in a set of pictures (yes/no), labeling a picture 1 of n labels, predicting whether or not a person is high risk for a diesease, etc. As we can see the key is the target attribute/label is a discrete set.\n",

    "Before Beginning, I notice that there's more examples of graduating than not. Because of this, it is important to note that we will want to have weights on the classes inversely proportional to class frequencies. This is especially true, because we especially care about the class label we see less of: not graduating. If we run models without class wieghts, we may get good accuracy or good f_1 scores, but we could definetly have this come about just because we do well labeling the graduating class (i.e. just getting the graduating class right would be 67% Acc). Anyway, all models will be run with class weight=“balanced”. I, also, add Accuracy and confusion matrix to model output in the following section. I would like to tell you before hand that it will be important to look at the confusion matrix's upper left quadrant because this value will tell you how many observations in the test set are correctly labeled as not graduating, which is the class we care about. Remember, we want to intervene to help students likely to not graduate graduate. We can afford (to some degree) to mislabel those graduating as not as long as we can catch a suffiecent amount of those that actually wouldn't graduate. The only thing loss by intervening with people who will graduate anyway is some lost man hours. \n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",

    "I mentioned earlier, it is important to understand what it is we actaully want to predict. In an ideal world we would like to predict both those that will and won't graduate perfectly. Unfurtunately, the data seems to not lend itslef well to that outcome. Because of this, we need to realize that we want to do well in both, but care more about (should put emphaisis on) predicting those who will drop out. The goal is to get 95% graduation rate; to do that, we need to intervene with those that would drop out. And if we accidently label some who would of graduated as dropouts, giving them some extra facetime surely wouldn't hurt (only waste some man hours). Therefore, I begin by saying it is important for which ever model we chose that it does well on predicting those that won't grduate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the best model at doing this on the test set is Support Vector Machines. Against Logistic, Random Forest, and ADA, on all three training sizes the SVM predicts the most number of dropouts correctly. The only one that somewhat competes on this metric is the Decision Tree, but it doesn't do this conisistly. Only on the 200 training set is it superior, and adding more points only makes it worse. I also fear the decision tree's overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now on other metrics- F1 and Accuracy- SVM performs a little better or slightly worse across different training set sizes. Yet, as mentioned previously, we should put emphasis on predicting droptouts; therefore SVM performs close on enough to the others to not be concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing the SVM performs poorly on (and this is expected) is time related metrics. But since the data set is small, it shouldn't be a concern. Even if we add in a few more years of data, just two schools wouldn't be an issue. \n",

    "The model chosen is called support vector machines. Without getting overly technical, the model is going to use various information the school collects/has on students and put that data into a useable format. The model can use all the data the school has; data could be things like tardiness, family size, gpa, etc. Using historic data with information on students that graduated and dropped out, we can learn a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets call all the data about a student the features and the specific question of wheter they dropped out the target. To explain how the model learns, let's look at a simple case where the school just has two features: Hours spent on HW, GPA and the target. We now put Hours spent on HW and GPAs of students on a simple coordinate plane with the students that graudated as red points and the students that droped out as green points. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"svmex.png\" alt=\"line\" style=\"width:400px;height:300px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After seeing it, one could simply put a line to seperate those that dropped out as opposed to graduated. However, many lines could be drawn to create the seperation. In SVM, we put an optimal line that is a line that creates as much space between the points on both side of the line as possible. This space is called the margin, and SVM always maximizes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for our case, SVM is like this, but in many dimensions (therefore it can deal with all the features we have on students) and draws a hyperplane as opposed to a line. Therefore, simply put, SVM finds a way to seperate the data geometrically on historical data. When new data is plotted, if you are to oneside of a line (hyperplane) you are predicted to do A and if on the other side you are predicted to do B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, some times the data is not easily seperable. SVM can deal with this in two ways. One way is allowing a small amount of errors, that is allowing wrong labels to be on the wrong side of the line/hyperplane and just minimzes the amount of times this happens. The other is called the kernel trick. This is a trick where we take already existing features, like GPA, Hours spent HW, etc and combine them together to make new features. These new features can be created in many different ways (almost anykind of function), and I won't go into it. The point is, the new feauture adds a new dimension to the data, and now the data maybe more easily seperated. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside) To try and help one understand (how adding a dimension can help get seperation), imagine we have just a number line from 1 to 10. And we have 2 points both plotted at 5. Obviosuly no seperation exists, but now imagine we add a y axis and both of the points have another feature. And there coordinates are 5,10 and 5,0. Now, we can see that we can easily seperate the points in 2 dimensions. A kernel trick can helps us do this in SVM, but instead of a new feature being magically revealed, other features in the data are combined in a way to create the new feature. One example may be something like X^2+Y^2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anway, once the model is taught with the historic data, all a school employeee would need to do is feed the data to the model and the model would return whether or not a studnet is predicted to graduate or not. "

    "Well, as expected, the tuned model's F1 score on the training set is higher. This is expected because we are optimizing with respect to this score in the grid search. This optimization (grid search) has worked very well for us on most measures. The F1 on the test has drastically increased, the overall accuracy has gone up and prediction times have decreased. The only concern I have, and its hard to say much about because of the small number of observations, but this tuned SVM predicts a smaller number of drop outs correctly on the tet set than the untuned model. \n",
